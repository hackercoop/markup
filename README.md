# markup

## overview

markup is a set of notation used to describe text more thoroughly.

## syntax

there are two ways to notate words:

1. if describing a single word, then prefix the markup notation to the beginning of the word.

examples:

    +ease
    @home

2. if describing many words, then call the markup notation like a lisp function with the words as arguments.

examples:

    (+ hacker coop)
    (@ muir woods)
